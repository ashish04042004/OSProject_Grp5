CPU Process Scheduler (OS Project by Group 5)
This project aims to implement the various CPU scheduling algorithms and display a GUI with all the algorithms, so that the user can select the algorithm which he/she wants to execute by giving the arrival time and the process time. The user can add or delete the number of processes. After the calculation, a Gantt chart is displayed with the processes, also a final table with processes, arrival time, total burst time, completion time, turnaround time, waiting time and response time is displayed to the user.Our Web Application provides us with a illustrative gantt chart, timeline chart , final timing table and the important final values like throughput, average waiting time etc,. Our Whole Web Application is based on basic pillars of web dev which are HTML,CSS and Javascript.
